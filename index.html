            Valorant is a tactical shooting game involving two teams with 5
            players in each team.Every game has 25 rounds and the team that wins
            13 of them first wins the game. Players can choose their in-game
            characters called agents at the start of the game. Players can buy
            abilities and weapons at the start of the game.

          <div class="big-overview">
            Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charge. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that have a shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately. Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, and hunters of every description.

              In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25
              - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking
              team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver
              and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations
              (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the
              activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything
              in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the defending
              team is able to deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round
              timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the
              defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are
              eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the
              defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the
              opposing team earns a point. If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden
              death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the
              match, differing from overtime for competitive matches.

              round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate,
              which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on
              the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be
              activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every
              player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the
              standard game are present, but there are multiple power-up orbs
              instead.

              Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the
              addition of a win-based ranking system which assigns a rank to
              each player after 5 games are played. Before you can play in
              competitive games, you will need to win 10 unrated matches
              beforehand. In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition
              for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden
              death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on
              attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by
              securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the
              same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as
              approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each
              group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw,
              requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and
              thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive
              ranking system ranges from iron to radiant. Every rank but
              immortal and radiant has 3 tiers.

              The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020. 14 players
              enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach
              40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins
              the match. Players spawn in with a random agent, and all abilities
              are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green
              health packs drop on every kill, which set the player at maximum
              health, armor, and ammunition, unless the player is using a
              machine gun, which only gives the player an additional 30 bullets.

              The Escalation gamemode was introduced in February 2021 and is
              similar to the "gungame" concept found in Counter-Strike and Call
              of Duty: Black Ops, though it is team-based rather than
              free-for-all with 5 players on each team. The game will pick a
              random selection of 12 weapons to move through. As with other
              gungame versions, a team needs to get a certain number of kills to
              advance to the next weapon and the weapons get progressively worse
              as the team moves through them. There are two winning conditions,
              one team needs to get through those levels, or if one team is on a
              higher level than the opposing team within 10 minutes.

          There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game.
          Each agent has a different class which indicates how the agent is
          usually played. Duelists are the offensive line, which specialize in
          attacking and entry fragging for the team. Sentinels are the defensive
          line, which specialize in locking down sites and protecting teammates
          from enemies. Next are initiators who plan out the offensive pushes.
          Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions.
          The last class are the Controllers, who specialize in setting their
          team up for success. They use their heavy utility to control
          sightlines on the map.

          Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter created by Riot Games. So far there
          are five maps with one objective: planting or defending against a bomb
          (called a “spike”). The five playable maps are called Bind, Haven,
          Split, Ascent, and Icebox. There is also a shooting range where you
          can sharpen your aim or practice simulated situations like defending a
          spike you planted. Each map also has two ultimate orbs in neutral
          locations that teams can try to grab. The orb grants one point the
          ultimate of the agent who picked it up.

            Valorant is deep, complex and it always pushes you to do your best
            and become a better player. It has everything to offer great and
            intense matches, but it also requires and level of cooperation and
            commitment that won’t appeal all players.

            Despite a few issues, Valorant has a compelling combination of
            twitch shooting and ability focused combat, fueled by kinetic
            gunplay and the ever-alluring temptation to get better. I’m excited
            to see where Riot take this title in the future, and as a
            free-to-play package, I implore you to download it.

            Valorant is one of those Counter Strike type of games but playing a
            group of preset characters with their unique abilities. I would say
            Valorant is pretty solid in terms of gunplay and balanced abilities,
            the abilities are the only new aspect of the game which are mostly
            about defending, distractions and front assault.
